This project is a product landing page template. It can have as many sections as needed. The navigation menu updates dynamically when sections are added or removed. Active sections are highlighted. The page navigates smoothly when a link in the navigation menu is clicked.

## Getting Started

To use this project, you simply need to add your content in each section, replacing the title and content with your own data. You can add links to media files to have a rich content experience.

### Prerequisites

Basic HTML and CSS knowledge are required. Sometimes you'll need to add an image to your section. To add an image you can use the \<img> tag. You can change the width and height of your image as preferred.

```
<img src = "URL to image goes here" alt = "text to show when image can't load goes here" width="400px" height="400px">
```


### Installing

To be able to use this template, you need to have it uploaded to your own server. This is outside the scope of this readme file. After that, this is what you need to do.

Open the index.html file using your favorite text/code editor. Two of the most famous code editors are Visual Studio Code and Atom.

Change the title of the first section

```
<h2>Your title goes here</h2>
```

Change the text inside the paragraph

```
<p>Your product description goes here</p>
```

Your image should be added before the product description.

## Running the tests

After adding your section, open your index.html file with your favorite browser. 

### Break down into end to end tests

If the page doesn't look as expected, do any necessary changes. 

To see if there's an error in your code, right click anywhere in the page and choose "inspect" or "inspect element" (based on the browser you are using). 

Click on console tab. If you see any errors try to fix them, or call your web developer for help.


### And coding style tests

You can change the foramtting of any item on the page using the css/style.css file. In the example below, you can change the font color of all your section titles.

```
h2 {
    color: green;
}
```

## Deployment

You can try and add/remove any section from your file. The navigation menu will automatically change to show the title of your section. Make the title short and let the details like your product model and specifications go inside the \<p> tag instead.
